1. critic net, critic target net, actor net, actor target net
2. replay buffer
3. for episode in M
   1. reset
   2. for step in episode
      1. get actor from state, + random N
      2. actor -> next states
      3. replay buffer push
      4. target_Q = target_next_Q(state)*gamma*(1-done) + reward
      5. loss (target_Q, critic net)
      6. update critic net
      7. update actor net
      8. update target net
